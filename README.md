# CS230

portfolio for class CS230 

This repository contains the completed software design document for The Gaming Room, developed as part of the CS 230 course. The main goal was to help The Gaming Room expand their Android game, "Draw It or Lose It," into a web-based game that works on multiple platforms. The software needed to support web access, multiple teams, unique usernames, and scalable and secure.

I think I organized the document well, making it easy to follow. I covered all the important requirements and gave detailed recommendations for things like the operating platform, system architecture, storage management, memory management, and security. My goal was to make the document clear enough that anyone, whether technical or not, could understand it.

Going through the design process helped me see how different parts of the system fit together. It wasn’t just about writing code but about ensuring everything would work well together in the long run. If I had to change something, I’d probably add more examples or diagrams in the memory management section to make it more straightforward, especially for those who aren’t as familiar with the technical details.

When it came to understanding what the users needed, I carefully looked at what the client was asking for and then translated that into the technical design. It’s super important to consider the user’s needs because the software must work for them. My approach to designing the software was to break down the problem into smaller parts and use principles like object-oriented design and the Singleton pattern. I’ll keep doing this in future projects, but I’ll also try to get feedback from users earlier in the process to ensure I’m on the right track.
